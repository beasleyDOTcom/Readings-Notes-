Passing by value vs passing by reference.
river.. if someone pee's in water down stream I'm not drinking pee water
numbers strings and booleans
passing by value: anything that won't take up too much space is given it's own spot in memory.
as soon as you assign it's value it stays that value even if you assign a different value to the myNewAge. 
Passing by reference:
pee in pool
arrays, objects.

when submitting a form you have to use event.preventDefault(); to keep the page from reloading on click and losing the info.

reference recognizes that the value has already been allocated memory and just points to it by reference.
