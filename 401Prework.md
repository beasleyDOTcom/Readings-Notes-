## how to solve problems
This artcicle lays out a method for problem solving that, if followed, can give the programmer confidence of reaching a solution. 
The main steps are:
Read the problem completely twice.
1. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
    1. __this step is super important__
1. Optimize the manual steps.
1. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
1. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
1. Optimize the real code.

__As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3.__

## Pretend your time is worth blah blah blah    
This article makes some good points and, I think, tells some truth, but beyond the token philosophy quotes, this article ignores the core issue of making meaning. 
This article assumes that the value of a life is measured by productivity, bashes people's simple pleasure in checking off boxes, as if the writer isn't obsessed with checking off boxes 
1. "If you want to become extraordinary and become 10x more effective than you were before, check out my checklist."

## how to think like a programmer (from freecodecamp)
The following is an example of what you will likely, instictively do:
1. Try a solution.
1. If that doesn’t work, try another one.
1. If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.
What you should do instead is:
1. Understand the problem
    1. How to know when you understand a problem? When you can explain it in plain English.
1. Plan
Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!

Nothing can help you if you can’t write down the exact steps.

In programming, this means don’t start hacking straight away. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.

To get a good plan, answer this question:

“Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”

Sidenote: Programmers have a great tool to help them with this… Comments!
1. Divide and conquor
Break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.

Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer).

After that, simplest means this sub-problem being solved doesn’t depend on others being solved.

Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots.
1. Stuck?
    1. Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).
    “The art of debugging is figuring out what you really told your program to do rather than what you thought you told it to do.”” — Andrew Singer
    1. Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?
    1. Also, delete everything and try again with a new perspective.
    1. Research, yeah google and stackoverflow.
