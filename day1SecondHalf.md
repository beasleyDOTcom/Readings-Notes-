## Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?
I like the way this article from freecodecamp.org portrays it: 
a library is like going to ikea to pickout furniture you can easily put together from preassembled bits. A framework is like picking a house in a new subdivision where there's a a certain number of layouts(frameworks) for the houses within.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
Rendering: displaying the product of your code. 
Templates: As far as I can tell, templates in this context refers to the idea that frameworks have their own sort of template use cases. Templates help you use them in the way they were designed. 
State: seems to refer to a particular present moment of a program.
