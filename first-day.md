#Pair programming
Pair programming helps programmers get realtime feedback and collaboration via a driver/navigator pair. The driver handles all of the actual input via the keyboard etc. and the navigator doesn't type anything, instead they are looking at the code you've written and catching errors while also looking ahead to see what kind of unexpected turns might be ahead and how to successfully drive through Los Angeles style algorithms.

Go to sleep, wake up and start at a faster pace. 
Catch up on the weekend.
