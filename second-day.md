# jQuery
The main benefit of jQuery as I see it, is how visually intuitive and simplistic is seems compared to vanilla javascript. While with vanilla javascript you may have to scroll around your page to see what jQuery can do in just a few lines of code. 
html and css element selection is quite simple and straightforward while still providing enough functionality to perform the majority of related functions.

# Pair Programming
Pair programming is a unique and powerful opportunity for deep learning. Pair programming gives us the opportunity to see from another programmers perspective and can help broaden the way we perceive the task at hand. It can also challenge the way we perceive ourselves and the impact we have on others. When we spend time listening to the way another person approaches, solves, and debugs we have the opportunity to glean from their experience and the parts of the language we are coding in that may have stuck with the other more than yourself -- and vice versa. 
Typically, pair programming is split up into a navigator and a driver. 
The driver is the one responsible for actually typing out the code while the navigator is responsible for looking ahead and planning a route forward.
