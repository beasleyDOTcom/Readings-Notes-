## ejs
the ejs videos I watched demonstrated a few simple but powerful abilities of ejs to use variables easily within html to put data into an html element, or to run if/else statements to decide what get's displayed, or a for loop to display every person.name in the people object. 
I am excited for what we will learn tomorrow.
## google api: volumes
I'm not reall sure what this is going to be yet. As far as I can tell, if your app needs the users data then there's a process for getting validated and then after that, the user agrees to share their info with you(app person) and google provides access to their api within the scope specified in the request.
